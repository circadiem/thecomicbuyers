          <div className="prose prose-gray max-w-none space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            <p>
              We started as <strong className="text-gray-900">Legends of Superheroes</strong> in 1993 —
              a small shop with a big passion for vintage comics. Over the next three decades we built
              one of the most respected buying operations in New England, purchasing thousands of
              collections from estate sales, private sellers, and long-time collectors looking to cash
              out or downsize.
            </p>
            <p>
              The process never changed much for 30 years: a seller would call, we'd drive out, spend
              a few hours manually assessing the collection, and make an offer. It worked — but it
              was slow, opaque, and inconsistent. A collection we'd seen at 9 PM after a long day
              got a different assessment than the same collection at 10 AM on a Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, we rebuilt the entire process around AI. We trained our identification system
              on hundreds of thousands of comics and integrated GoCollect's real-time market data
              into every valuation. The result: sellers get an instant, objective appraisal based on
              actual sales data — before we even make the drive. We see the same report you see.
              There are no surprises.
            </p>
            <p>
              We still make the drive. We still pay in cash, same-day. But now every seller knows
              exactly what they have before we arrive.
